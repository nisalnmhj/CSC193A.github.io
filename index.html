    <h1>I am Nishan Maharjan</h1>
    <p>I am a passionate and result-driven Computer Science student actively looking for an internship in the related field of Computer Science. I am <strong>expected to
    graduate in the Spring of 2025</strong> .In my academic journey, I have delved into a range of coursework including Calculus I, II, and III, Data Structures, Assembly Language,
    Unix, Networking, Theory of Computation, and Computer Architecture equipping me with a strong foundation in computer science principles. My hands-on approach to learning 
    is exemplified through diverse projects that showcase my proficiency in <strong>Figma, Python, JavaScript, NodeJS, SQL, React, Redux, Java, </strong> and more.
    One notable project I led was the development of an Inventory Request System for Valley Tech Systems. Applying Agile methodology, I designed a user-friendly interface using Figma and 
    employed JavaScript and NodeJS for seamless equipment request processing. This project demonstrated my ability to deliver innovative solutions and collaborate effectively within a team.
    To know more about my projects and me, checkout my <a href="https://nishan-portfolio.netlify.app/" title="Nishan Portfolio"> <strong> portfolio </strong> </a>. <br/> I go to California State Universiy, Sacramento.
